## Contents of The Repository
There are **three** folders and **two** files in our repository named "Stat628-Module2"
- *data*: we included our original data in this file
- *code*: we included our R code in this file
- *image*: we included images supporting our findings of the analysis in this file
- *Summary.pdf*: This is a two page summary of our procedure of developing this model. The contents include our overall findings, the evidence supporting our findings, and important details of our statistical analysis.
